# VAE-GAN-Pok-mon-generator
Variational Autoencoder trained on 809 Pokémon sprites for image generation, reconstruction, and latent space interpolation. Includes β-VAE, augmentations, and PyTorch training pipeline.

## Overview
This project implements a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** trained on a curated dataset of **809 Pokémon sprites**.  
The goal is to explore generative modeling on a small dataset, perform interpolation experiments, and analyze latent space structure.

Because the dataset is much smaller than typical image-generation datasets, this project focuses on:
- training stability  
- augmentation strategies  
- β-VAE experiments  
- latent space interpretability  

This repository demonstrates practical skills in:
- Deep Learning / VAE architectures  
- PyTorch training pipelines  
- Image preprocessing & augmentation  
- Generative model evaluation

## Features
-  VAE architecture with configurable latent dimension  
-  β-VAE option for disentanglement  
-  Reconstruction of Pokémon images  
-  Latent space interpolation  
-  Augmentation to improve generalization on small dataset  
-  Checkpoint saving and reproducible experiments  
-  Lightweight training

## Dataset
**Pokémon Image Dataset (809 sprites)**  

**This repository includes the dataset** because it is small.
